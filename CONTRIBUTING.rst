Making a pull request
=====================

Blocks development occurs in two separate branches: The ``master`` branch is the
development branch. If you want to contribute a new feature or change the
behavior of Blocks in any way, please make your pull request to this branch.

The ``stable`` branch contains the latest release of Blocks. If you are fixing a
bug (that is present in the latest release), make a pull request to this branch.
If the bug is present in both the ``master`` and ``stable`` branch, two separate
pull requests are in order.
