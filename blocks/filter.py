    Parameters
    ----------
    roles : list of :class:`.VariableRole` instances, optional
        Matches any variable which has one of the roles given.
    bricks : list of :class:`.Brick` classes or instances, optional
        Matches any variable whose brick is either one of the given
        bricks, or whose brick is of given classes.
    each_role : bool, optional
        If ``True``, the variable needs to have all given roles.  If
        ``False``, a variable matching any of the roles given will be
        returned. ``False`` by default.
    name : str, optional
        A regular expression for the variable name. The Blocks name (i.e.
        `x.tag.name`) is used.
    application : :class:`.Application` instance
        Matches a variable that was produced by the application given.

    Notes
    -----
    Note that only auxiliary variables, parameters, inputs and outputs are
    tagged with the brick that created them. Other Theano variables that
    were created in the process of applying a brick will be filtered out.

    Note that technically speaking, bricks are able to have non-shared
    variables as parameters. For example, we can use the transpose of
    another weight matrix as the parameter of a particular brick. This
    means that in some unusual cases, filtering by the :const:`PARAMETER`
    role alone will not be enough to retrieve all trainable parameters in
    your model; you will need to filter out the shared variables from these
    (using e.g. :func:`is_shared_variable`).

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from blocks.bricks import MLP, Linear, Sigmoid, Identity, BIASES
    >>> mlp = MLP(activations=[Identity(), Sigmoid()], dims=[20, 10, 20])
    >>> from theano import tensor
    >>> x = tensor.matrix()
    >>> y_hat = mlp.apply(x)
    >>> from blocks.graph import ComputationGraph
    >>> cg = ComputationGraph(y_hat)
    >>> from blocks.filter import VariableFilter
    >>> var_filter = VariableFilter(roles=[BIASES],
    ...                             bricks=[mlp.linear_transformations[0]])
    >>> var_filter(cg.variables)
