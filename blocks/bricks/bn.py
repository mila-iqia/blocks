class BatchNormalization(RNGMixin, Feedforward):
    r"""Normalizes activations, parameterizes a scale and shift.

    Parameters
    ----------
    input_dim : int or tuple
        Shape of a single input example. It is assumed that a batch axis
        will be prepended to this.
    broadcastable : tuple, optional
        Tuple of the same length as `input_dim` which specifies which of
        the per-example axes should be averaged over to compute means and
        standard deviations. For example, in order to normalize over all
        spatial locations in a `(batch_index, channels, height, width)`
        image, pass `(False, True, True)`. The batch axis is always
        averaged out.
    conserve_memory : bool, optional
        Use an implementation that stores less intermediate state and
        therefore uses less memory, at the expense of 5-10% speed. Default
        is `True`.
    epsilon : float, optional
       The stabilizing constant for the minibatch standard deviation
       computation (when the brick is run in training mode).
       Added to the variance inside the square root, as in the
       batch normalization paper.
    scale_init : object, optional
        Initialization object to use for the learned scaling parameter
        ($\\gamma$ in [BN]_). By default, uses constant initialization
        of 1.
    shift_init : object, optional
        Initialization object to use for the learned shift parameter
        ($\\beta$ in [BN]_). By default, uses constant initialization of 0.
    mean_only : bool, optional
        Perform "mean-only" batch normalization as described in [SK2016]_.

    Notes
    -----
    In order for trained models to behave sensibly immediately upon
    upon deserialization, by default, this brick runs in *inference* mode,
    using a population mean and population standard deviation (initialized
    to zeros and ones respectively) to normalize activations. It is
    expected that the user will adapt these during training in some
    fashion, independently of the training objective, e.g. by taking a
    moving average of minibatch-wise statistics.

    In order to *train* with batch normalization, one must obtain a
    training graph by transforming the original inference graph. See
    :func:`~blocks.graph.apply_batch_normalization` for a routine to
    transform graphs, and :func:`~blocks.graph.batch_normalization`
    for a context manager that may enable shorter compile times
    (every instance of :class:`BatchNormalization` is itself a context
    manager, entry into which causes applications to be in minibatch
    "training" mode, however it is usually more convenient to use
    :func:`~blocks.graph.batch_normalization` to enable this behaviour
    for all of your graph's :class:`BatchNormalization` bricks at once).

    Note that training in inference mode should be avoided, as this
    brick introduces scales and shift parameters (tagged with the
    `PARAMETER` role) that, in the absence of batch normalization,
    usually makes things unstable. If you must do this, filter for and
    remove `BATCH_NORM_SHIFT_PARAMETER` and `BATCH_NORM_SCALE_PARAMETER`
    from the list of parameters you are training, and this brick should
    behave as a (somewhat expensive) no-op.

    This Brick accepts `scale_init` and `shift_init` arguments but is
    *not* an instance of :class:`~blocks.bricks.Initializable`, and will
    therefore not receive pushed initialization config from any parent
    brick. In almost all cases, you will probably want to stick with the
    defaults (unit scale and zero offset), but you can explicitly pass one
    or both initializers to override this.

    This has the necessary properties to be inserted into a
    :class:`blocks.bricks.conv.ConvolutionalSequence` as-is, in which case
    the `input_dim` should be omitted at construction, to be inferred from
    the layer below.
