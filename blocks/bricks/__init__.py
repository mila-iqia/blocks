class Brick(object):
    """A brick encapsulates Theano operations with parameters.

    A brick goes through the following stages:

    1. Construction: The call to :meth:`__init__` constructs a
       :class:`Brick` instance with a name and creates any child bricks as
       well.
    2. Allocation of parameters:

       a) Allocation configuration of children: The
          :meth:`push_allocation_config` method configures any children of
          this block.
       b) Allocation: The :meth:`allocate` method allocates the shared
          Theano variables required for the parameters. Also allocates
          parameters for all children.

    3. The following can be done in either order:

       a) Application: By applying the brick to a set of Theano
          variables a part of the computational graph of the final model is
          constructed.
       b) The initialization of parameters:

          1. Initialization configuration of children: The
             :meth:`push_initialization_config` method configures any
             children of this block.
          2. Initialization: This sets the initial values of the
             parameters by a call to :meth:`initialize`, which is needed
             to call the final compiled Theano function.  Also initializes
             all children.

    Not all stages need to be called explicitly. Step 3(a) will
    automatically allocate the parameters if needed. Similarly, step
    3(b.2) and 2(b) will automatically perform steps 3(b.1) and 2(a) if
    needed. They only need to be called separately if greater control is
    required. The only two methods which always need to be called are an
    application method to construct the computational graph, and the
    :meth:`initialize` method in order to initialize the parameters.

    At each different stage, a brick might need a certain set of
    configuration settings. All of these settings can be passed to the
    :meth:`__init__` constructor. However, by default many bricks support
    *lazy initialization*. This means that the configuration settings can
    be set later.

    .. note::

       Some arguments to :meth:`__init__` are *always* required, even when
       lazy initialization is enabled. Other arguments must be given before
       calling :meth:`allocate`, while others yet only need to be given in
       order to call :meth:`initialize`. Always read the documentation of
       each brick carefully.

    Lazy initialization can be turned off by setting ``Brick.lazy =
    False``. In this case, there is no need to call :meth:`initialize`
    manually anymore, but all the configuration must be passed to the
    :meth:`__init__` method.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name : str, optional
        The name of this brick. This can be used to filter the application
        of certain modifications by brick names. By default, the brick
        receives the name of its class (lowercased).

    Attributes
    ----------
    name : str
        The name of this brick.
    lazy : bool
        ``True`` by default. When bricks are lazy, not all configuration
        needs to be provided to the constructor, allowing it to be set in
        another way after construction. Many parts of the library rely on
        this behaviour. However, it does require a separate call to
        :meth:`initialize`. If set to ``False`` on the other hand, bricks
        will be ready to run after construction.
    print_shapes : bool
        ``False`` by default. If ``True`` it logs the shapes of all the
        input and output variables, which can be useful for debugging.
    params : list of Theano shared variables
        After calling the :meth:`allocate` method this attribute will be
        populated with the shared variables storing this brick's
        parameters.
    children : list of bricks
        The children of this brick.
    allocated : bool
        ``False`` if :meth:`allocate` has not been called yet. ``True``
        otherwise.
    initialized : bool
        ``False`` if :meth:`allocate` has not been called yet. ``True``
        otherwise.
    allocation_config_pushed : bool
        ``False`` if :meth:`allocate` or :meth:`push_allocation_config`
        hasn't been called yet. ``True`` otherwise.
    initialization_config_pushed : bool
        ``False`` if :meth:`initialize` or
        :meth:`push_initialization_config` hasn't been called yet. ``True``
        otherwise.

    Notes
    -----
    To provide support for lazy initialization, apply the :meth:`lazy`
    decorator to the :meth:`__init__` method.

    Brick implementations *must* call the :meth:`__init__` constructor of
    their parent using `super(BlockImplementation,
    self).__init__(**kwargs)` at the *beginning* of the overriding
    `__init__`.

    The methods :meth:`_allocate` and :meth:`_initialize` need to be
    overridden if the brick needs to allocate shared variables and
    initialize their values in order to function.

    A brick can have any number of methods which apply the brick on Theano
    variables. These methods should be decorated with the
    :meth:`apply_method` decorator.

    If a brick has children, they must be listed in the :attr:`children`
    attribute. Moreover, if the brick wants to control the configuration of
    its children, the :meth:`_push_allocation_config` and
    :meth:`_push_initialization_config` methods need to be overridden.

    Examples
    --------
    By default, bricks have lazy initialization enabled.

    >>> import theano
    >>> from blocks.initialization import IsotropicGaussian, Constant
    >>> linear = Linear(input_dim=5, output_dim=3,
    ...                 weights_init=IsotropicGaussian(),
    ...                 biases_init=Constant(0))
    >>> x = theano.tensor.vector()
    >>> linear.apply(x)  # Calls linear.allocate() automatically
    linear_apply_output
    >>> linear.initialize()  # Initializes the weight matrix

    In simple cases, eager bricks are easier to deal with.

    >>> from blocks.initialization import IsotropicGaussian, Constant
    >>> Brick.lazy = False
    >>> linear = Linear(5, 3, weights_init=IsotropicGaussian(),
    ...                 biases_init=Constant(0))
    >>> linear.apply(x)
    linear_apply_output
